title: Yellowbird Chicken Wings

  - spicy
ingredients:
  - 2lb chicken wings
  - salt/pepper/garlic
  - 4 tbsp Yellowbird Hot Sauce
  - 2 tbsp butter
directions:
  - Season your wings with salt/pepper/garlic at least 4 hours before cooking. Even better overnight.
  - Start on the grill, I usually smoke low (under 300°) over oak coals for about 1 hr. The chicken should get a nice color, but don't worry about getting them done-done here.
  - To make the wing sauce, melt the butter and mix with Yellowbird.
  - Move all the wings to a sheet pan, and put under a ripping hot broiler (450°+). After a minute or two, flip the wings. Broil and flip and broil and flip until the wings look perfect to you. We usually lean on the well-done side.
  - In a big bowl, toss the wings in the wing sauce. If you want to do a few other flavors, split the wings into a few bowls with a few sauces.

An all-time classic, these chicken wings use a two-step cook process that's a) easy to time, and b) **makes a TON of wings**. The trick is to start on the grill, and finish under a ripping hot broiler. The final wing is smokey, crispy- the best of both worlds!

You can also do the first half of the cook (the grill) and then hold the wings at temp in a warm oven until you're ready to eat. Late guests? Got another batch on the grill? It's super easy to float the timing and zap them crispy fresh whenever you're ready. **Then sauce and serve, you wing king.**

When it comes to sauce, our favorite is **[Yellowbird Strawberry Ginger](https://www.yellowbirdfoods.com/products/strawberry-ginger-hot-sauce)**, but any variety of hot sauce works here. Or just a couple different, just like a wing joint.
