Probably one of the healthier things I eat, with the added bonus that it's super easy and fun to sprout your own bean sprouts. All you need is a dark space and a couple days, and this meal grows itself.

Coupled with the fact that the whole thing probably costs about $1 per serving, this dish is a real winner.
