ingredients:
- 1 lb shrimp
- 6 large sea scallops
- 1 mango
- 1 serrano pepper
- 1/4 red onion
- 1 celery stalk
- 4 limes
- 1/4 can coconut cream
- ginger
- garlic
- honey
- 1 avocado
- cilantro

directions:
- Thaw (if needed) and wash the shrimp. Remove any veins. Our favorite are Argentine red shrimp. Dice shrimp into small cubes.
- Thaw (if needed) remove the small muscle from the scallops. Dice into small cubes.
- Dice the mango, then slice the serrano pepper, celery, and red onion as thinly as you can manage.
- Add the shrimp, scallops, mango, serrano, and red onion to a bowl. Zest 2 limes into the bowl.
- To make the tiger's milk, in another bowl, combine the juice of four limes, the coconut cream, the ginger (we use frozen cubes, about 1 tbsp), 4+ cloves of garlic, a couple pieces of serrano pepper, and a big shot of honey. Add a couple cubes of shrimp and scallop (or fish, whatever), and blend until smooth.
- Add the tiger's milk to the main bowl, tossing to cover the shrimp/scallops/mango. Set in the fridge for 30-45 mins, but no longer than an hour.
- Dice the avocado into small cubes, add to the bowl right before serving (sometimes the avocado can get sloppy if it sits too long).
- Top with cilantro and serve with fresh chips. Tip! If you had especially leafy celery, use the leaves to make a bed for the ceviche when serving.

We like to travel, and we like to eat, and I'd say at the top of that intersection list might be ceviche. If we're near a coast, we eat some kind of ceviche. One of our favorites is tiger's milk ceviche, a tangy, creamy, spicy mix of seafood and fruits,

Turns out, you can just.... make ceviche at home. It's crazy simple, and totally flexible. Try adding any kind of fish, sub the mango for orange supremes, change the heat levelsâ€“the sky's (or the sea's) the limit.
